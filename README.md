# About
As a test, this program uses two 450x450 matrices generated by the matrixUtils script. These matrix files can be found in the `test/` folder.

Additionally, two random 450x450 matrices are used, which were generated from by the site: https://onlinemathtools.com/generate-random-matrix.

# Instructions to Run
In the project root directory, use the command:
`python3 main.py`

# Report
Implementing the matrix multiplication functionality was straight forward. I just had to follow the mathematical constraints (like the matrix 1 must have the same number of col as rows in matrix 2). As of now, UI functionality is non-existent. The tests just run when the program is executed. This is just to demonstrate the matrix multiplication functionality working.
One thing worth noting, the time it takes to mutliply matrices with sizes of at least 500x500 take longer than 15 seconds. Futhermore, matrices with sizes above 1000 take unnecessary amount of time as a serial program. I expect with a parallel implementation, speeds will drastically increase.
